Lexicographic Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (LPOMDPs) are MOPOMDPs with lexicographic preferences over the optimization of value functions, allowing for slack in their optimization. Lexicographic Value Iteration (LVI) for LMDPs solves this problem, but is too computationally expensive in practice. We include Lexicographic Point-Based Value Iteration (LPBVI) which approximates the optimal solution.
